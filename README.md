# ArtemisFinancial
For this project, I work as a developer for a software engineering company called Global Rain with Artemis Financial as my client.  I was assigned to address any security vulnerabilities in the code provided to me and to document any findings.

Based on the work that has been done in the past eight weeks, respond to each one of the following questions: 

**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?**

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that creates personalized financial plans for its customers, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. They look to modernize their operations with the latest software security measures, specifically needing a file verification step in their web application to ensure secure data transfer through a checksum mechanism.

**What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?**

I excelled in identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities in Artemis Financial’s software by conducting complete assessments and implementing strong security measures. Coding securely is vital to protect sensitive client data and prevent breaches. Increased software security boosts client trust, ensures compliance with regulations, and safeguards the company's reputation and financial health.

**Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**

The most challenging part was ensuring that the new checksum-based file verification integrated seamlessly with existing systems without disrupting functionality. This process was helpful in increasing my skills in secure coding practices and in my understanding of secure communication protocols.

**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**

I increased security layers by implementing checksum verification for data transfers, ensuring data integrity and secure communication. In the future, I would continue using dependency management and vulnerability reports, alongside manual code reviews, to assess vulnerabilities and decide on appropriate mitigation techniques.

**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**

I ensured functionality and security by thoroughly testing the code through Eclipse IDE, verifying that checksum verification worked correctly and did not interfere with existing operations. After refactoring, I generated new dependency reports and conducted comprehensive testing to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**

I used Eclipse IDE for code modifications, testing, and dependency management. Adopting practices like generating dependency reports, performing checksum verifications, and conducting thorough code reviews proved invaluable and will be beneficial in future projects.

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**

I would show detailed reports on the implemented checksum verification process, before-and-after code comparisons, and dependency reports highlighting the identified and mitigated vulnerabilities. These examples would demonstrate my ability to increase software security while maintaining functionality and reliability.
